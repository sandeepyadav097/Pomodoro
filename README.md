Pomodoro Timer

This is a pomodoro timer exclusively designed and coded by me.
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals ,separated by short breaks.
An interactive element has been added which acts according to the time.
Sounds have also been included.
